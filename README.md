# The Hackend Project

The official website for **the hackend project**.


--------

This website will be used as follows 
* A landing page where other developers get all the info they require. 
* A blog where we can post updates. (About the hackend project, and interesting new technology in general)
* A tagging system wherein people can register their weekend hack under a tag. When someone searches by tag - all relavent project links should be displayed. 
* This website won't contain any weekend hacks - just curated links.
